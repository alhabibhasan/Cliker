# Cliker

A mobile app that allows you to connect to a firebase realtime DB to set the value of a flag.

This flag can then be watched by other applications to trigger certain events.

For example, I am using it as a slide show remote control.

To use:
1. Clone the repo.
2. `cd repo; npm install; npm start`

It uses Expo, so you might want to download that on to the phone you want to test it out on.
